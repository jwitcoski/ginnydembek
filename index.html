												<h2>Research, Teaching, and Service</h2>
											</header>
											
											<h3>Research Focus</h3>
											<p>My research agenda focuses on Intervention research. This type of research allows
											teachers to apply the work in the field with high validity and reliability. I have six peer-reviewed
											publications, and was co-editor for a special issue of the Journal of Research in Childhood
											Education. My recent publications are focused on how students with disabilities or students in
											foster care can be supported in educational settings.</p>
											
											<p>My research focuses on four distinct areas:
											problem solving in literacy, literacy instruction and tutoring, writing instruction, and enhancing
											teacher candidate preparation with universal design for learning (UDL). I have presented my
											work at national and international conferences.</p>
											
											<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
											<p>The courses I teach at Brooklyn College allow me to focus on supporting my
											expectations for teacher candidates to apply evidence-based interventions in public school
											settings. I maintain high standards for expectations of teacher candidates and mastery of
											knowledge related to student/civil rights and teaching as a science. It is also important for my
											teacher candidate students to engage in reflective application of skills and strategies,
											emphasizing teaching and learning as a life-long process.</p>
											
											<p>A teacher candidate's ability to apply knowledge and reflect on their performance is changed more effectively through ongoing
											mentorship and guidance in the field. Ongoing mentorship and guidance are built into my courses
											and how I engage with students through their coursework.</p>
											
											<h3>Current Work</h3>
											<p>Since joining the School of Education in August 2013, I have deepened and expanded my
											research in problem solving, writing instruction, literacy instruction/ tutoring, and UDL in
											teacher preparation. My research in problem solving during the reading process involves a new
											type of instruction to help students with problem solving language, including both explicit
											lessons and frequency building to a performance criterion (FBPC).</p>
											
											<p>I built an intervention that requires students to speak up about their understandings and challenges during problem solving
											tasks. Students with disabilities overwhelmingly struggle with the language necessary to
											communicate information to teachers, and my intervention has shown success in teaching this
											skill.</p>
											
											<p>After my intervention, students with disabilities are able to voice their strengths and
											challenges, required to succeed in a general education classroom. Similar to think aloud skills,
											my research in writing instruction focused on explicit instruction and frequency building. In
											addition to classroom-based intervention research, I have expanded my work to include
											evidence-based literacy tutoring methods in collaboration with the New York Foundling.</p>
											
											<p>Foster youth have a significantly higher chance of receiving special education services (Gee, 2020;
											Scheer, 2007), linking this work directly with my current goals. My most recent research project
											has involved locating funding and training opportunities to enhance teacher preparation in
											special education within technology and Universal Design for Learning.</p>
